##Setup

The set up was started with creating your basic react-app and then beginning to install all of your
dependencies like React-Router. After that the user table and sign up tabs were made. More to come...

Demonstration of CRUD
----------------------

>Create: go to the Sign up tab and create a user after that you will see that it will send you a user page and on this
page it shows a list of all the users.

>Read: On the user page it fulfills the the read part of it.

>Update: When you click on the Update/Delete it will route you to another page where you can change the users
info, submit and update after that it will re-route you and you will need to refresh the page to see the changes

>Delete: Click the same button go there and then you will click delete and boom re-route and then refresh the page and it 
will be gone.
